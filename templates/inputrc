# /etc/inputrc: initialization file for readline
#
# For more information on how this file works, please see the
# INITIALIZATION FILE section of the readline(3) man page
#
# Quick dirty little note:
#  To get the key sequence for binding, you can abuse bash.
#  While running bash, hit CTRL+V, and then type the key sequence.
#  So, typing 'ALT + left arrow' in Konsole gets you back:
#    ^[[1;3D
#  The readline entry to make this skip back a word will then be:
#    "\e[1;3D" backward-word
#

# disable display of '^C' and other control characters
set echo-control-characters off

# use case-insensitive file name matching and completion
set completion-ignore-case on

# list all ambiguous completion matches immediately
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# do not show hidden files in completion matches unless
# the pattern begins with `.`
set match-hidden-files off

# disable confirmation before listing many completion matches
set completion-query-items -1

# display completion matches without columns
set completion-display-width 0

# enable non-stupid behavior when completing inside a word
set skip-completed-text on

# vi mode
set editing-mode vi

$if mode=vi
  # clear screen in insert mode
  set keymap vi-insert
  "\C-l":clear-screen

  # disable left and right cursor movement so that we learn to use command mode
  set keymap vi-command
  "\e[C":redraw-current-line
  "\e[D":redraw-current-line
  set keymap vi-insert
  "\e[C":redraw-current-line
  "\e[D":redraw-current-line
$endif
